        <h3>The Bottom Line</h3>
        <p>
          Your organization stands at a critical juncture. With 92% adoption but significant 
          confidence gaps and environmental concerns, employees have moved beyond questioning 
          whether to use AI to actively seeking guidance on how to use it effectively, ethically, 
          and sustainably. The workforce is ready for comprehensive AI transformation, but needs 
          targeted training and clear ethical frameworks to succeed.
